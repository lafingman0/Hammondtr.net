	<h1>Introduction to Ship Types</h1>

	<p>It is my greatest goal that the gameply mechanic of the game will be fun. I believe the most significant factor in this success if ship mechanics.
	There are many gameplay styles I want to incorporate from my favorite games. For example, I would like one ship type to be long-range, "ranger"-type
	ships. I would like a stealthy "assassin"-type ship. I would like a robust, hack n' slash type ship. I would like a ship that is extremely large and rather immobile,
	yet summons mobile units (ala a carrier). I would like each ship to be support for the others. I should probably define more definite roles for utilities.

	One speciality support/repair ship and/or helicopter. 

	One heavy tanker, useful for multiple things.
