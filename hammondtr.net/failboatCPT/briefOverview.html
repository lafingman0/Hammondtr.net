	<h1>FailboatCPT - A Brief Overview</h1>
	
	<p>
	FailboatCPT is a game that I have been having ideas about for roughly a year. I have an idea of where I want to go with the game,
	but I am not exactly sure how I will implement it. What the game will be:
	</p>

	<p>
	FailboatCPT will be a multiplayer, campaign-based, RPG-style ship building game, with elements including nods to SCHMUPS/Raiden, simple
	yet complex gameplay reminsicent of tetris, and in-depth balance/team building for the high-difficulty events (difficulty curve somewhat familiar
	to diablo. There will be many things the player can upgrade, including their hangar, ships, etc and will be fueled by a currency that is generated
	per mission. Completing groups of missions may unlock certain upgrades: special harpoons perhaps, or a special jetski-craft.
	</p>

	<p>While I will focus largely on multiplayer gameplay as the benchmark experience. I want players to be able to try out different types of gameplay
	(ie different ships) and build them on their own time. For this reason, there will be a mode for single-person missions, that may include
	being able to use your entire hangar, being able to 'tab' between your different ships.</p>

	<h2>Ship Building</h2>

	<p>
	Each ship will be analagous to an MMO character, and should take quite awhile to 'build' and customize. The rough idea behind customization is as follows:
	</p>

	<p>
	There will initially be sixteen ship types. When a player begins, they can choose between three types, and more unlocked throughout the story.
	For each type, certain utilities available, and propulsion is set.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Ships will have utilities (similar to skill trees), which they can choose depending on their hull size. Certain utilities - ie summon aircraft, are
		only available to specific hulls. In this case, the aircraft carrier. A common utility may be "direct gunfire" or something similar.</li>
		<li>Ships will have reputations. As you use your ship in more advanced missions, you will gain reputation and currency. You may use currency on certain
		armaments, new hulls, hangar upgrades, visual changes, etc. A ship's reputation determines how significant of upgrades it may have equipped.</li>
		<li>As mission level increases, and ship utilities expand, players will find that a solid mix of utilities will be needed to complete missions.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This is the process of building a ship:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Name</li>
		<li>Hull Size (1-12), layout</li>
		<li>Propulsion Utility</li>
		<li>Other Utilities, limited by hull size</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Each utility is progressed as a 'skill tree'. Certain abilities will have prerequisite reputation, equipment, and crew. Players will be able to choose
		up to 6 abilities (possibly more) to be active during any mission.
	</p>


	<h2>Mission Structure</h2>
	<p>
	The player will be introduced immediately to the port. Immediately introduce way to join parties with friends. Next the ship yard and missions are offered that
	each offer an individual story line. Each of the example missions are EXTREMELY condensed versions and will have meaty, interesting storylines.
	</p>

	<p>
	I will implement a javascript version of the ship builder to determine the specifics and to work as a prototype.
	</p>

	<p>
	An example mission may be that someone got a tip that their ship was the target of pirates, and their ship is in need of an escort.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Another example would be a mission where a known criminal is in port, and they need a vigilante to take them out once they get into open waters.
	</p>

	<p>
	A third example may be.. a radical environmentalist group approaches you about mercenary work, sabotaging a fishing operation because of harm to dolphins.
	You may choose to side with the environmentalists or the fishing company (fight on either side).
	</p>

	<p>
	Higher level missions may involve government contracts, and you may choose to work for multiple counties. For example, China might need reconaissance on U.S.
	Navy inventories. And vice-versa. There may be a civil war on a British imperial island, and you have to choose which side to be on. Could include South American
	Brazillian slave trade missions.
	</p>

	<p>
	I want to somehow implement polar locations, but I'm not quite sure how. Maybe a general "exploration" mission. Maybe a 'Conquer Antarctica' story arc, where the
	different divisions of Antarctica are in conflict for some reason; will bring up the treaty of 1962 that split antarctica up for research purposes.
	</p>

	<p>
	Missions are based on the player location (port). Most missions are multiplayer missions, based on parties of three. Some ports must be unlocked by an epic
	voyage across uncharted territory. Might attempt to implement a solo mode, in which a player may control multiple ships from their hangar at a time, with the
	ability to pause. Progress will be saved on a single-player and multiplayer basises.
