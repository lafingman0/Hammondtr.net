	<h1>FailboatCPT - A Brief Overview</h1>
	
	<p>
	FailboatCPT is a game that I have been having ideas about for roughly a year. I have an idea of where I want to go with the game,
	but I am not exactly sure how I will implement it. What the game will be:
	</p>

	<p>
	FailboatCPT will be a multiplayer, campaign-based, RPG-style ship building game, with elements including nods to SCHMUPS/Raiden, simple
	yet complex gameplay reminsicent of tetris, and in-depth balance/team building for the high-difficulty events (difficulty curve somewhat familiar
	to diablo. There will be many things the player can upgrade, including their hangar, ships, etc and will be fueled by a currency that is generated
	per mission. Completing groups of missions may unlock certain upgrades: special harpoons perhaps, or a special jetski-craft.
	</p>

	<p>While I will focus largely on multiplayer gameplay as the benchmark experience. I want players to be able to try out different types of gameplay
	(ie different ships) and build them on their own time. For this reason, there will be a mode for single-person missions, that may include
	being able to use your entire hangar, being able to 'tab' between your different ships.</p>

	<h2>Ship Building</h2>

	<p>
	Each ship will be analagous to an MMO character, and should take quite awhile to 'build' and customize. The rough idea behind customization is as follows:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Ships will have utilities (similar to skill trees), which they can choose depending on their hull size. Certain utilities - ie summon aircraft, are
		only available to specific hulls. In this case, the aircraft carrier. A common utility may be "direct gunfire" or something similar.</li>
		<li>Ships will have reputations. As you use your ship in more advanced missions, you will gain reputation and currency. You may use currency on certain
		armaments, new hulls, hangar upgrades, visual changes, etc. A ship's reputation determines how significant of upgrades it may have equipped.</li>
		<li>As mission level increases, and ship utilities expand, players will find that a solid mix of utilities will be needed to complete missions.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This is the process of building a ship:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Name</li>
		<li>Hull Size (1-12), layout</li>
		<li>Propulsion Utility</li>
		<li>Other Utilities, limited by hull size</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Each utility is progressed as a 'skill tree'. Certain abilities will have prerequisite reputation, equipment, and crew. Players will be able to choose
		up to 6 abilities (possibly more) to be active during any mission.
